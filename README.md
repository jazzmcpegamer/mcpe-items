# mcpe-items
Minecraft PE inventory pictures used in ShopUI and other UI plugins.

# Why use these?
if you check out the ShopUI plugin I uploaded some time ago you will notice in the main.php file that the pictures all supplied by a website. If that website link is down or the link changed your item picture will not be shown in the UI.

# recomendations
If you run your mcpe server using a vps upload it there so you do not have to worry about the items not showing up if the link is down.
